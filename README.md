## My first emulator, gameboy emulator.
---
I am learning how to write operating systems and I want to learn how to write emulators too. I am referencing to following materials:
* https://mgba-emu.github.io/gbdoc/
* https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables/
* https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.6.1/gbz80.7/

### What implemented?
In current day, I have implemented the following things:
* carry out opcodes from 0x00 to 0x1f
---
This work is like a routine work, but I like this work, because I have created beautiful things in the future.
